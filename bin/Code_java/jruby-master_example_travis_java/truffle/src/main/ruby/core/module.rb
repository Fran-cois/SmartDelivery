##
# Some terminology notes:
#
# [Encloser] The Class or Module inside which this one is defined or, in the
#            event we are at top-level, Object.
#
# [Direct superclass] Whatever is next in the chain of superclass invocations.
#                     This may be either an included Module, a Class or nil.
#
# [Superclass] The real semantic superclass and thus only applies to Class
#              objects.
